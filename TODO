TODO:

* Determine if smaller objects go faster than larger ones, if not change it so it is that way.

* Only the overlapping part of a prey object should be gobbled up, not all of it.

IDEAS:

* Change over to adding energy to objects rather than force

* When accelerating you should eject the mass that accelerates you, out, the ejected mass should become
another object just like any other one, also with AI.

* The background jumps around because BG_INIT_W_SIZE isn't at a ratio (multiple or division) of DEFAULT_WIDTH,
I should make sure whenever the window size changes BG_INIT_W_SIZE also changes, I'll need to regenerate the BgData,
I'll need to save the random seed to allow regeneration.
Or I could copy paste the contents of BgData into a larger or smaller BgData array.

WONTFIX:

* Add collision avoidance to ai objects.

DONE:

* Allow spectating other object, center on objects and switch between selected one.

* Add different colors to predators and prey, so they can be easily seen

* Change over background from image loading to blitCircle().

	-[DONE] Add shifting (parallax) background
	
	-[DONE] Add tiling support
	
* Add start screen to prevent game from starting when not ready, also removes advantage a player might have over the AI
regarding a early start.

	-[UNNEEDED] Font are needed and a way to load and manage them, an idea is to have a sdlStore/objectStore like function which can 
	be called with the name of the font (including extension) and the font size, if the font isn't loaded then the store
	function should load it then return with the details to use it, if it is loaded then skip the loading part (as it's 
	already done) and return as normal.
