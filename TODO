TODO:
* Change over background from image loading to blitCircle().
	- Add tiling
	- Add shifting background
	
* Add start screen to prevent game from starting when not ready, also removes advantage a player might have over the AI
regarding a early start.

IDEAS:
* Change over to adding energy to objects rather than force

* When accelerating you should eject the mass that accelerates you, out, the ejected mass should become
another object just like any other one, also with AI.

WONTFIX
* Add collision avoidance to ai objects.
